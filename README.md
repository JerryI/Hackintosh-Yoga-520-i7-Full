<h3>Update 30/04/2022</h3>

- Fixed video patch that didn't enable audio and video on HDMI
- the config.plist file has been replaced with the fix and the old one has been renamed to configOLD.plist if it is still useful in the future, but it can be removed from the folder without any problem in your hackintosh.

<h3>Update 19/04/2022</h3>

- Upadate ACPI DSDT, touchpad precision correction.
- Improved power management.
- Added kext yogaSMC.kext to activate secondary keys from F4 to F10 keys. <a href="https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC"> see installation instructions.</a>

<h3>Update 04/04/2022</h3>

- Added folder EFI OC version 0.8 Mod-no-acpi monterey

# Update MacOS Big Sur 11.6

<p align="center">
<img src="img/Big_Sur.png">
</p>

<h3>Update 04/04/2022</h3>

- Updated KEXTS Folder OC 0.7.8 Big Sur


# Bugs
- When turning on MacOS, sometimes the keyboard and mouse do not work on the OC screen until you enter windows and exit or reset nvram.
- One way around this is by selecting the Mac partition and typing Ctrl + Enter to always start on it by default, and when using Windows, press the f12 or Fn + F12 key and choose the windows boot partition if it is on a disk different from mac.
- If the two systems tverem on the same disk a solution can be shut down using the power button or use an external mouse or keyboard, I can not describe this situation well since my systems are on different disks.


# Heads up
* see id layout tests to enable headphone output microphone (jack connector)

# Bonus
- 2 Themas, 

<h3>how to install themes!</h3>

- Delete the Resources and Tools folders inside the EFI - OC folder and replace them with the ones inside the themes file.
